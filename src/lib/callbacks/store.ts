 * Resolves the tenant for a verified callback, from the registration alone.

 * `x-fluid-shop`, or `company.fluid_company_id` out of the body, would let the
 * holder of tenant A's token sign a request naming tenant B and be served as B.
 * Those fallbacks would fire exactly when the binding is weakest, which is when
 * guessing is least defensible.
 *
 * Note the lookup is `findFirst`, not `findUnique`: Rails put a plain index on
 * `companies.droplet_installation_uuid`, not a unique one, and the schema keeps
 * that faithfully.
 *
 * Returning null is an auth failure, and is the correct outcome.
