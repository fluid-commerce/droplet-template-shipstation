/**
 * Adopting callback verification tokens for an installation that predates the
 * SDK, or that has been re-registered.
 *
 * The mechanism is the SDK's `backfillCallbackTokens`, wrapped in a staged swap.
 *
 * ## Why staged
 *
 * The SDK's backfill upserts as it goes and never prunes, so a registration
 * Fluid deleted and recreated leaves the dead row behind — and a check that
 * asks only "is there a row for this definition" is satisfied by that dead row
 * while every live request carries the new token and is refused.
 *
 * Deleting first fixes the pruning but opens a window in which the installation
 * has NO digests, and every callback that arrives during it is refused. On a
 * fail-open route that is a silent 200.
 *
 * So: collect the whole replacement set in memory, check it covers every
 * enabled callback, and only then delete and insert in a single transaction.
 * The installation's digests are never removed before their replacements are in
 * hand, and any failure leaves the previous set exactly as it was.
