/**
 * Webhook endpoint.
 *
 * Port of app/controllers/webhooks_controller.rb, wrapped in the SDK's
 * `withFluidWebhook`.
 *
 * Webhooks are not the checkout path, so this route refuses loudly: an
 * unverified request gets a 401 and nothing runs. That is the opposite of the
 * callback routes, and it is deliberate — a rejected webhook is a retry, while
 * a rejected callback is a broken cart.
 *
 * What the wrapper replaces, and why it is an improvement on the Ruby:
 *
 *  - The Rails controller authenticated `droplet.installed` / `droplet.uninstalled`
 *    by comparing `params[:company][:droplet_uuid]` against the configured
 *    droplet uuid. That is a value the caller supplies, so anyone who knew the
 *    droplet's uuid — which Fluid publishes in the marketplace — could forge an
 *    install and hand this droplet a `companies` row with credentials of their
 *    choosing. Here the same events are verified by HMAC against the shared
 *    bootstrap secret, and the uuid check remains as a routing guard inside the
 *    handler rather than as the authentication.
 *  - Every other event was authenticated by a plaintext `AUTH_TOKEN` header
 *    compared with `include?` — not timing-safe, and satisfied by the SHARED
 *    webhook token, so any installed company's token authenticated a webhook
 *    about any other company. Here a non-bootstrap event must verify against
 *    that company's own `webhook_verification_token`.
