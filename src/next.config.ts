/**
 * Next configuration.
 *
 * ## Why this file is inside `src/` rather than at the repo root
 *
 * Next resolves its app directory with `findDir(root, "app")`, which prefers
 * `<root>/app` over `<root>/src/app` and offers no way to override it. This
 * repo still contains the Rails app at `app/`, so building from the repo root
 * makes Next scan Rails' directory, find no routes, and emit an empty app.
 *
 * So Next is pointed at `src` as its project directory (`next build src` — see
 * the scripts in package.json), which makes `src/app` the app router and puts
 * this config, `tsconfig.json` and `next-env.d.ts` beside it.
 *
 * When the Rails app is removed in the follow-up PR, these three files move up
 * one level and the commands lose their `src` argument. Nothing else changes —
 * no source file moves, no import path changes.
